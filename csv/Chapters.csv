0,0,Exploring Freshwater Mussel Distribution and Its Relationship to Dam Density within Massachusetts Watersheds,imgs/eastern floater img.jpg,Source: NH Fish and Game,https://www.wildlife.nh.gov/,,15.75,Hidden,,"Raleigh, NC",42.0314015,-73.0029458,https://mapwarper.net/maps/tile/51816/{z}/{x}/{y}.png,0.9,,
1,1,Importance of Freshwater Mussels,imgs/state of MA.png,,"Freshwater mussels play a critical role in maintaining aquatic ecosystems. They act as natural water filters, removing particles like algae, bacteria, and sediment to improve water quality. This study focuses on the Eastern Floater, a native mussel species in Massachusetts, and explores how their distribution relates to the presence of dams within the stateâ€™s watersheds.",16,Plain,blue,15 E PEACE ST,35.7882396,-78.6373757,,,,
2,2,What Was Studied and Why,,,,"The study aimed to understand the relationship between the locations of Eastern Floaters and the density of dams in Massachusetts. Using data from public databases and citizen science platforms, researchers analyzd where these mussels are found and how close they are to dams. This information can help inform conservation strategies in regions like New England, where dams are common.",16,Plain,blue,118 E SOUTH ST,35.771817,-78.6379858,,,,
3,3,How the Study Was Done,,,,"Researchers used data from iNaturalist to map mussel sightings and combined it with dam location data from MassGIS. They processed this information using Python programming to create three visualizations: 1. A map showing where mussels and dams overlap across watersheds. 2. A histogram illustrating the distance of mussel sightings to the nearest dam. 3. A bar chart highlighting average distances between mussels and dams in different watersheds. The analysis revealed patterns in mussel distribution, shedding light on how dams might affect their habitats.",16,Plain,blue,1315 OAKWOOD AVENUE,35.7844945,-78.6206819,,,,
4,4,Key Findings,,,,"The study showed that most Eastern Floaters were found within 2,000 meters of a dam, suggesting a possible link between dam proximity and mussel habitats. However, the relationship might also reflect sampling biases, as mussels in accessible or urbanized areas were more likely to be reported. Interestingly, watersheds with fewer dams did not always have more mussels, indicating that other environmental factors may also play a role.",16,Plain,blue,2200 HILLSBOROUGH STREET,35.7864724,-78.6644827,,,geojson/NCSU_campuses.geojson,fillColor:red;color:black

8,8,Challenges and Future Research,,,,"One limitation was the reliance on citizen science data, which may not capture the full range of mussel habitats. Some areas had little to no data, making it difficult to draw broad conclusions. Future studies could include more systematic surveys and examine other mussel species to better understand how dams influence aquatic ecosystems.",16,Plain,blue,3000 WAKEFIELD CROSSING DRIVE,35.9427849,-78.5562419,,,,
