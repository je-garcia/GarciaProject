0,0,Exploring Freshwater Mussel Distribution and Its Relationship to Dam Density within Massachusetts Watersheds,imgs/eastern floater img.jpg,Source: Fish and Game Department,https://www.wildlife.nh.gov/,,35.7796,-78.6382,https://mapwarper.net/maps/tile/51816/{z}/{x}/{y}.png,0.9,,,,,
1,1,Importance of Freshwater Mussels,imgs/state of MA.png,Image Source: World Population Review,https://worldpopulationreview.com/,"Freshwater mussels play a critical role in maintaining aquatic ecosystems. They act as natural water filters, removing particles like algae, bacteria, and sediment to improve water quality. This study focuses on the Eastern Floater, a native mussel species in Massachusetts, and explores how their distribution relates to the presence of dams within the stateâ€™s watersheds.",16.0,Plain,blue,15 E PEACE ST,35.7882396,-78.6373757,,,
2,2,What Was Studied and Why,,,,"The study aimed to understand the relationship between the locations of Eastern Floaters and the density of dams in Massachusetts. Using data from public databases and citizen science platforms, researchers analyzed where these mussels are found and how close they are to dams. This information can help inform conservation strategies in regions like New England, where dams are common.",16.0,Plain,blue,118 E SOUTH ST,35.771817,-78.6379858,,,
